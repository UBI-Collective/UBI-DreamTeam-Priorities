Registry of internal Rebel Improvement Proposals

## Submitting an rHIPs Request

Submit a new potential rHIP as an [issue](https://github.com/UBI-Rebel-Alliance/rHIP/issues/new) with the rHIP issue template. Follow the status of the potential rHIP through the [rHIP Request](https://github.com/UBI-Rebel-Alliance/rHIP/projects/1) project. Accepted Finalized rHIPs are added as Pull Requests closing the Issue.

During the Consideration phase, we should use the opportunity to find apprentices to provide opportunities for them to earn their place in the Alliance.

## rHIPs

Post your ideas, in the form of an issue, for a Rebel Improvement Proposal!

If you have an idea that YOU think would help the UBI token maintain and rise in value, facilitate the registry of people in remote areas, or improve the way the UBI Rebel Alliance operates, then drop it here for someone else to pick-up.

The UBI Rebel Alliance members post ideas that they have for improvements to the Alliance, if you are interested in joining us and see an issue that you would like to lead then let the Alliance know by posting the issue URL in the [Tavern](https://discord.gg/tCqejWszXY) and we'll start a rHIP channel for you to run the show.

Feel free to ask for help or seek some allies for you rHIP on Discord.
