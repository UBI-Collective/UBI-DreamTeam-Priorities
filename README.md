## HPPs

Post your ideas, in the form of an issue. Then post it in the #Proposals Discord channel. Get others to join you in turning your idea into reality and get the chance for getting funds for rewarding the whole team!

If you have an idea that YOU think would help the $UBI token maintain and rise in value, facilitate the registry of people in remote areas, or improve the way the PoH operates, then drop it here for someone else to pick-up.

The UBI Rebel Alliance members have sworn fidelity to end poverty by facilitating both the autonomous product development of the PoH ecosystem and by assisting the community in understanding better what is PoH and how to contribute.
If you are interested in joining us and see an issue (project) that you would like to lead then let the Alliance know by posting the issue URL in the [Tavern](https://discord.gg/tCqejWszXY) and we'll start a HPP channel for you to run the show.

Feel free to ask for help or seek some allies for you HPP on Discord.
