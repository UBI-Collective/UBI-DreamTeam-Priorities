# Raid Credits
### Project Submitted By

Dekanbro

## Summary

We are doing is a simple "video game credits" type of marque with all members

## Why should we build this?

It is a nice bit of branding that could be linked to from raidguild.org or any of our projects with the 'built by raidguild' badge, an easter egg.


## Anything else you'd like to add?

start of the animation to get an idea of what im talking about.

API
https://caletaxp.herokuapp.com/raidbot/members

So the top part would be the animation and the bottom part would be a scrolling marquee of all the members. has to be dynamic because members are coming and going.
