# RaidGuild Treasury Accounting

### Project Submitted By

Manolingam (Saimano)

## Summary

A complete documentation, analysis and report for the treasury as of 06 June 2020.

## Why should we build this?

There isn't a proper documentation regarding the use of guild funds and it's management so far. So, it's required to analyse and generate reports periodically to get some insights.

## Anything else you'd like to add?

This would be a maiden initial sprint of the analysis. Might require another sprint in future.

## Raid Party Skills Needed

- Basic data management & analysis.

## Cost (in USD)

\$250
