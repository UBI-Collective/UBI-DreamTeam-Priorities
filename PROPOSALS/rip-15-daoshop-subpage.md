# DAOshop Subpage

### Project Submitted By

burrrata

## Summary

Create a subpage for DAOshop: daoshop.raidguild.org

## Why should we build this?

Makes DAOshop look official. Also makes it easy for people to pay for a DAO consultation. This will allow us to vet quality projects as well as get rewarded for the time we spend answering questions and putting together proposals.

If it works the rest of the guild can fork it and use it for their consultations too.
