# RaidGuild ens and subdomains

### Project Submitted By

Dekan

## Summary

Moloch DAOs should have a DAO managed ENS through the minion

example: <memberName>.raidguild.eth subdomains


## Why should we build this?

* Adds easily recognizable address for members and clients (Name Recognition & Branding)
* Easier to trust and easier to remember a .raidguild.eth domain (more professional)
* Could be used for permissioned views on dot org and handbook, private chats/messaging 
* DAO owns root domain and issues subdomains through Minion
* DAO bank can have a subdomain, raid multisigs could have a subdomain
* batch the subdomain creation


## Anything else you'd like to add?

### Initial research:

* https://github.com/ensdomains/subdomain-registrar
* https://github.com/decentraland/avatars-contract
* ens deployments (outdated) https://docs.ens.domains/ens-deployments 
* ENS subgraph https://thegraph.com/explorer/subgraph/ensdomains/ens

### Minion interface idea

This could be interacted with by the generic minion submit form but Because this will be a deployed contract eventually owned by the minion we can make some further assumptions (contract address, better UI/UX). I think this pattern would work well with other minion owned contracts like certificates and airdrops, tc
