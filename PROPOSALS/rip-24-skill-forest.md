# Raid Guild Skill Trees

## The Demon
Skill trees most commonly seen in strategy and RPGs, may be the cheat code for members to understand where they are, set goals, and keep from stagnation. As the guild grows we need these tools to be able to profile ourselves and each other, we need to stay engaged in the game. A skill tree reputation system, if built in an open way, on a open platform like ethereum can not only inform us, but maybe a tool that is able to be leveraged for good by the greater public ecosystem.
Some of our current issues are 
* it is hard to tell what skill level members are at, because of this it is hard to know which members from the front tavern have the ability to engage clients, and lead consultations, it is even harder then for them to engage with the back tavern to help build the right raid team for a quest.
* New members joining do not have much direction, we throw them from the tavern into the town square with out much else for next steps
* The raiders that are very active need a way to recognize the experience they are gaining by taking a more active role.
* personal growth, honing skills, or branching into new skills should be recognized and supported by our culture.

## The tools and weapons at our disposal
Raidguild, besides being a leader in the space of future of work also has many tools in our inventory to help make this happen. The community and our 9000 years combined experience is our strongest tool. On top of this we also have side chains, NFT platforms and DAO platforms to help slay this demon.

## Adventure begins
Currently we have done a fair amount of exploration into a raidguild skill tree and the larger skill forest. We have been partaking in the Skill Forest working group with members of the larger ethereum community. Deep work, TEC, Metagame, Daohaus and others are aligned in the quest to experiment and eventually standardize a system of skills, recognition, and personal growth.
