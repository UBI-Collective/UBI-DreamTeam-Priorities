# Project Idea

Optimize the 'hire us' form to bring in more high-quality project submissions

## Project Submitted By

## Summary

The rate of client submissions has greatly decreased since requiring a 300 DAI consultation fee. We see potential clients side-stepping this process, reaching out in other channels to ask questions about their project and get opinions from Raiders. Our hypothesis is there is resistance to pay a fee before speaking with a Raider to see if it could be a fit. Possible issues with paying in DAI. Or some other reason related to the latest form updates.

We'll kick off this project with a round of user research (with clients) to better understand their needs, motivations and opinion of the form and fee. The result will be a persona document which represents the needs of our ideal Raid Guild client and ideas for how we can best support them.

Once we have tested our assumptions about what potential clients need, we'll design improvements to the 'hire us' form and post-submission process. Then we'll implement the most high-value ideas, keep an eye on the metrics and keep iterating until we are seeing an increase in high-quality submissions.

## Why should we build this?

Improving the client submission process will benefit:

- Clients: Peace of mind, confidence when deciding whether to engage with Raid Guild
- Raiders: Moar raidz! Moar $$$ for the guild bank
