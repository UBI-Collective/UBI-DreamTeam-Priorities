## Summary

A escrow service for Guild clients. For each new Raid, a new Minion proposal will be submited that formally begins the Raid and spins up a new escrow account. Clients will then be able to deposit funds into the escrow and release them to the Raid Party following agreed-upon milestones.

## Why should we build this?

The escrow service and surrounding functionality will accomplish several goals for the Guild:

1. Ensure that client money exists and is earmarked for payment to the Guild / Raid Parties
2. Formalize the process by which clients pay the Guild / Raid Parties for services
3. Give clients additional assurances that they will receive value for their payment
4. Formalize the process for beginning a raid, which will double as the creation event for the [raid-specific Series LLC](https://gateway.ipfs.io/ipfs/QmSAEHbdswCB3dduYBYE78TUyGxzgbqqoWmYjA1DF81hAT)

This infrastructure will be open source and designed to be reusable by other DAOs.

## Anything else you'd like to add?

The escrow service is part of a larger vision for [Raid Ops Automation](https://hackmd.io/HMe_w3bBTKaOY2_2v2U2vg). Assuming the result of this RIP works as expected, additional RIPs will be proposed build out that broader vision.

## Raid Party Skills Needed

- Warrioring to build client and guild admin UI 
- Archery to design client- and guild-facing UI
- Wizardry to write and verify the smart contract
- Monking / Barding / businessing to help define requirements
- Scribing to produce content describing the escrow service and Guild partnership with LexDAO
