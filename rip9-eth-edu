# Project Idea

### Project Submitted By

Simona Pop and Yalor (with help from many others)

## Summary

Eth Education is an initiative that maps and streamlines the education resources avaliable for developers looking to learn more and start coding on Ethereum. 


## Why should we build this?

This is something that will be helpful to RaidGuild specifically to help apprentices level up their skills, take on more raids with greater range earning potential. Beyond the Guild a cohesive and streamlined educational resource hub for mentoring new devs and pointing them to avaliable resources will be essential to the adoption and expansion of our eco-system.

## Anything else you'd like to add?

The developer specific focus is a starting point which we are most familiar with, being mostly developers, but the next itterations could be focused on learning any of the following  "Writing about Ethereum" , "Marketing Ethereum" , "PM for Ethereum Dapps" etc etc. If the framework is made modular and open-source it can be deployed with any content avaliable. 

## Raid Party Skills Needed
