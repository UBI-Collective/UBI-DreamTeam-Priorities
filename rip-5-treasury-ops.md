2. General crypto management (Set up crypto tracking software to automate tracking of expenses, income, transfers, and trades. SOP for process)

## Why should we build this?

As we embark on a crypto native adventure, ensuring finances are taken care of from the very beginning becomes especially important.

Treasury formation enables the Raid Guild to build a solid foundation off of which future finance improvements will be made.

## Anything else you'd like to add?

I believe this is a good base for treasury formation. Future efforts will focus on automation, streamlining process, and treasury communications to the Raid Guild.
