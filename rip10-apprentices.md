## Summary

The apprentice program is the system by which new members of the guild work their way into a full membership role. 
It's an on-going process that we aim to systematize more over time, with the help of tooling and issues requests sent via DM's on Discord and an active PM overseeing the progress of each new applicant. 

## Why should we build this?

The Guild has an active community of new members looking for things to do, also there are certain monetary restrictions that stop some folks from pledging their way into the DAO.
This program seeks to enagage Apprentices (Potential DAO members) in a feild they are comfortable tackling certian issues or tasks therebye creating an in-road to membership that does not require the staking of any funds. 

## Anything else you'd like to add?

This is a very open ended program, that will likely be on-going as we expand the DAO, needing constant refinement. Very open to more systems engineer-type folks jumping in and helping flesh out how to take the individual work done by **Tavern-Keepers** and automate some/all of it.
