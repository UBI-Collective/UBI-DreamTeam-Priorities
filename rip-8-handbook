# Raid Guild Handbook

### Project Submitted By

Cooper Turley

## Summary

Overhaul of the Raid Guild Handbook as a resoucre for new and current members
Full proposal post here: https://forum.raidguild.org/t/raid-guild-handbook-proposal/47

## Why should we build this?

If done effectively, the Handbook will serve as a central point of reference for people with questions about the Guild and it's high level structure. Memebrs can simply say "Go read the handbook" instead of having to field the same question 100 times.
