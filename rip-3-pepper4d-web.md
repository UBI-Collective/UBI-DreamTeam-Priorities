# Pepper4d Leaderboard on the web

### Project Submitted By

Dekan.eth

## Summary

Create a web view of the data tables created from nodered chat bot. Nodered and api endpoints are already setup. We Just need an easy way to view player stats and rankings. 

## Why should we build this?

Pepper4d is a fun way to do social reputation through a telegram chatbot. A leaderboard on the web would make a nice way for players to see stats and current rankings. This is mearly a POC but could grow to link players with ethereum address, incorporate on chain reputation and host multiple guilds games.

There has been some interest from larger groups to fund this further so a small POC may help to showcase idea.

This seems like a good first RIP to sink our teeth into as a team.
